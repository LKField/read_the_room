# Read the Room 

A project to read light level and temperature in a room and generate a sound based on the "mood" in the room. 

Inital Goal fed to the OpenAI: "read the temperature and light level of the room to determine the mood and atmosphere then output a melody that matches the atmosphere."

Future Plans:  
Integrate Spotify API into the system to create a playlist based on on the "mood" in the room
